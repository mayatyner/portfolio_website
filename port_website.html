			While I have many projects I've worked on, this project is by far the most thorough and earliest project I've completed. This site was developed while working at a call center in Salt Lake City, after receiving permission
			from my supervisor. Since I was using a workplace computer, I settled for using NotePad to develop this website. NotePad also provided the opportunity to fully immerse myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript since I had no assistance
			from autofill tools or debuggers.
		</p>

		<h3 class="pink">Programming Experience</h3>

		<p>
			In highschool, I had worked on a few websites for classes and National Honor Society.
			While HTML and CSS are not new languages for me, JavaScript is, and my experience with HTML and CSS were
			limited to very barebones websites.
		</p>

		<h3 class="pink">Design and Development</h3>

		<p>
			I went into this project fairly blind regarding what my end-product would look like. I
			visited other student portfolios from other schools and cherry-picked details that I liked or disliked.
			Most notably, I noticed a lack of readability in other websites. Using Adobe Color, I created a color
			palette that both appealed to me, and was readable. I also wanted a large, sans-serif font, since serif fonts tend to be more difficult
			to read on smaller screens. Outside of these key factors, I wanted a website with a straightforward
			design that reflected my personality, without detracting from the projects hosted on this site.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most importantly, this website was designed with the intent to reflect my strength in website
			development languages.
		</p>

		<p>
			As stated above, it was very important for this website to be scalable to all, if not, most
			devices. A majority of people use their cellphones on a day-by-day basis, and I wanted to accomodate
			that need.
		</p>

		<h3 class="pink">Hosting</h3>

		<p>
			Since I lack the hardware to host my own website, I decided to host my website through BlueHost. I opted for BlueHost
			because of their security benefits and affordability. In their File Manager, I uploaded my source code.
			My BlueHost domain redirects to these HTML files.
		</p>

		<p>
			When it comes to hosting websites, I have very little experience, which is why, come Fall 2022,
			I am taking a Web Development course to hopefully get a better understanding of hosting.
		</p>

		<h3 class="pink">Next Steps</h3>

		<p>
			Unlike other projects on this site, a website it always changing and will always be improving.
			Moving forward, I want my website to have the following features:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Animations In Page Changes</li>
			<li>Polish Hyperlinks</li>
			<li>Scaling Fonts</li>
			<li>Implement External Fonts (i.e. Google Fonts) </li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="pink">Files</h3>
