	<p>While I have many projects I've worked on, this project is by far the most thorough and earliest project I've completed. This site was developed while working at a call center in Salt Lake City, after receiving permission
from my supervisor. Since I was using a workplace computer, I settled for using NotePad to develop this website. NotePad also provided the opportunity to fully immerse myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript since I had no assistance
 from autofill tools or debuggers.</p>

	<p>Throughout the development of this website, outside of learning the aforementioned languages, I learned that website development, from scratch, is incredibly meticulous work. It requires keen attention to details and 
a strong understanding of wrappers, despite a lack of classes. In the case of HTML, "classes" are already developed. It's up to the programmer to utilize these classes properly to create a desired look. An excellent example 
of this is the homepages "Work Experience" section:</p>

	<h3 class="pink">Wrapper Example</h3>

	<div id=code>
		<iframe src="port_home.txt" width="1000" height="800" frameBorder="1"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>The above code contains a div labeled "work". This work class then contains a header with the class "pink".
In my CSS code, "pink" denotes text that needs to be placed inside a pink block. Also inside of "work",
 there is the div "positions", which lists each position and a description. Since these segments of code 
are already inside of "positions", they require no further description. Instead, they are referenced in
 the CSS as "#positions > p" and "#positions > h3".</p>

	<p>There are numerous examples of this throughout the entire website, but this is one of the simpler examples.</p>
