        <h3 class="pink">Programming Experience</h3>

        <p>
            The class, called Software Practices I or CS3500, was centered on programming in C# and learning to create a presentable project.
            This assignment was completed around the midpoint of the class, so I had already completed a handful of C# assignments. A majority of this project was completed solo
            , but the final phase (additional features), was completed with a partner.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pink">Development</h3>

        <p>
            Throughout the entire development of the application, our professor provided skeleton code with methods and short descriptions, up until the final phase.
            During the final phase, I and my partner picked out 2-3 features we wanted to add. In the case of our project, we added 4 ways of sorting data, color themes,
             and sound effects.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below is a list of all features that were required by the professor:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Formulas and Handling Cell Dependencies</li>
            <li>Handling of Invalid Values (strings in formulas)</li>
            <li>Editing Content of Cells</li>
            <li>Saving and Loading Spreadsheet Files</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="pink">Final Product</h3>
