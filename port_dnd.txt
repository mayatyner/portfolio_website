<p>A Dungeons and Dragon character creator for players to create a character with minimal steps, and
 no dice rolling.</p>

<h3 class="pink">Programming Experience</h3>

<p>In CS3505, at the University of Utah, we programmed solely in C++. The latter half of that same course
 was centered around QtCreator and application development. Unlike many of my peers, I really liked 
QtCreator. For me, the rendering of a project from barebones to optimal user experience is satisfying.
</p>

<h3 class="pink">Planning and UML</h3>

<p>I started with what I wanted the user experience to be and features I wanted to include. Below is
 a list of the features I intend on including: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Optional Randomization</li>
	<li>Dice Roll Animation and Sound Effects (including settings to turn these off)</li>
	<li>PDF Export Option</li>
	<li>Auto-Save and Load Characters on Boot through .pcs (player character sheet)</li>
	<li>Level Up Support</li>
	<li>Edit Character Spells, Feats, and Names</li>
</ul>
