            A basic Qt Application developed for CS3505 while attending the University of Utah. <strong>
                Since this project was completed
                as a part of a class, I cannot post the code publicly.

        <h3 class="pink">Programming Experience</h3>

        <p>
            The class, called Software Practices II or CS3505, was centered on programming in C++ and in teams/pairs.
            This assignment was completed around the midpoint of the class, so I had already completed a handful of C++ assignments. However, this was my
            first time using QtCreator and their UI designer. Since this was my first time using QtCreator, it's not nearly as strong as my final project for this class.
            <a href="port_gameplanner.html">See the 'Game Planner' project for a more polished example of QtCreator.</a>
        </p>

        <h3 class="pink">Development</h3>

        <p>
            As with most class projects, especially an early project, there was little to no planning involved in this project. We were instructed to make a Simon Says game
            with 2 phases: CPU and Player's Turn. Our only creative freedom with this project was the user interface and an additional feature of choice. I decided to add difficulty options, which speed up the CPU phase.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since this was my first project in QtCreator, the application wasn't designed to be full screen and it does not scale. It was one of my polish features, but
            due to only have a few days to complete this project, I ended up not making the window scalable. Below is a list of all features that were completed:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>CPU/Player Phase</li>
            <li>Tracker for Number of Buttons Clicked</li>
            <li>Round Tracker</li>
            <li>Difficulty Settings</li>
            <li>Two Colored Buttons which Flash During CPU Phase</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="pink">Final Product</h3>
