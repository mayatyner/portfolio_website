<h1>Website Project</h1>
<p><strong>Timeline: </strong>April 2022-Ongoing</p>
<p><strong>Languages: </strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
<p><strong>Programs: </strong>NotePad</p>


<p class="lime">While I have many projects I've worked on, this project is by far the most thorough and earliest project I've completed. This site was developed while working at a call center in Salt Lake City, after receiving permission
from my supervisor. Since I was using a workplace computer, I settled for using NotePad to develop this website. NotePad also provided the opportunity to fully immerse myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript since I had no assistance
 from autofill tools or debuggers.</p>

<p class="lime">Throughout the development of this website, outside of learning the aforementioned languages, I learned that website development, from scratch, is incredibly meticulous work. It requires keen attention to details and 
a strong understanding of wrappers, despite a lack of classes. In the case of HTML, "classes" are already developed. It's up to the programmer to utilize these classes properly to create a desired look. An excellent example 
of this is the homepages "Work Experience" section:</p>
