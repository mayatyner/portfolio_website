            An online multiplayer game about tanks firing projectiles at their opponents. <strong>
                Since this project was completed
                as a part of a class, I cannot post the code publicly.
            </strong>

        <h3 class="pink">Programming Experience</h3>

        <p>
            The class, called Software Practices I or CS3500, was centered on C# and learning how to create finished products, from beginning to end.
            This was the final assignment of the class, and was completed in partners. I was already very familiar with C# at this point, and felt confident about
             my understanding of the language. This assignment was moreso a test about one's ability to create a working project within parameters.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pink">Development</h3>

        <p>
            Our project had a two week timeline, with two phases. One was the Model- which contained all the logic regarding the tanks, walls, and world. The second phase
             was the View- which handled refreshing and debugging logic in the model. Typically, I work from a list of functions, create a mock view, and then program the logic, 
            so it was really interesting creating a project in this format, and I definitely recognize the benefits of this process.
        </p>

        <p>The only point of creative freedom in this project was the death animation, which was decided by myself and my partner. We chose to do red and yellow
         circles that appear randomly within a range of numbers. This is supposed to mimic the appearance of an explosion.</p>

        <p>
            Here is a list of the features in our Tank Wars game:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Connect to a Game Server with Other Players</li>
            <li>Fire Projectiles with Mouse and Move using Arrow Keys</li>
            <li>Collect Power Ups to Fire a Beam using Right Mouse</li>
            <li>Collision Between Walls and Tanks</li>
        </ul>
