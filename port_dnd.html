		<h3 class="pink">Programming Experience</h3>

		<p>
			I've never programmed in either of the above programming languages. Prior to starting this project, I reviewed some examples of React and used a beginner's tutorial to better understand the project.
			My partner on this project, <a href="http://www.ryanvreeke.com">Ryan Vreeke</a>, has prior experience in SQL. I left the majority of the SQL in his capable hands, while taking this as an opportunity to learn more about
			SQL.

		<h3 class="pink">Planning and UML</h3>

		<p>
			I started with what I wanted the user experience to be and features I wanted to include. Below is
			a list of the features I intend on including:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Select Current Character</li>
			<li>View all important stats</li>
			<li>Remove/Add Health</li>
			<li>Cast Spells </li>
			<li>Update Inventory</li>
		</ul>
