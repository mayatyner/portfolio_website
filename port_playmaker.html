			This was a team assignment, which could range from 4-6 people working on a
			single learning application. Since this was a mass group project, there
			were aspect that I did not contribute to. The entire project will be
			discussed in Design and Development, but the exact parts I worked directly
			on will be discussed in Final Product.
		</p>

		<p>
			For my team’s learning product, we elected to create and interactive
			play maker for football teams. It was developed using QtCreator and C++
			per our professor’s instruction. This assignment was the final for
			CS3505/Software Practices II.

			For this assignment, we did a scrum approach to our project. We had
			two days to discuss prior to the beginning of the programming phase. D
			uring the programming phase, we aimed for 3 meetings a week. During these
			meetings, I would transcribe everyone’s accomplishments, obstacles, and
			goals. In place of meetings, we occasionally did message check-ins and
			I’d review everyone’s progress on the GitHub daily.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since all of our schedules were very different and we wanted to avoid
			having to meet anymore than necessary with finals approaching,
			we split our project into three parts: the playmaker, the play
			viewer, and the quiz portion. This made it easier to split the work.
			This ensured we weren’t repeating work that someone else may have
			done, but not yet pushed.
		</p>

		<p>
			We also created a list of most to least important tasks. For everyone’s
			roles during the week, we would have 1-2 required tasks, 1-2 quality of
			life tasks, and 1 polish task. For example, for our playmaker, we had
			additional time during the second week of the project, so we wanted to
			try adding animation. A required task would be a pause and play button,
			a QOL task would be a full-screen button, and a polish task would be
			interpolating frames.
		</p>

		<p>Below are some documents from our planning phase:</p>

		<ul>

		</ul>

		<p>In summary, below is a list of all features we managed to include: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Place Players and Opponents Onto a Field</li>
			<li>Move Players and Opponents and Create New Frames</li>
			<li>Playback Animation in Play Creator</li>
			<li>Save and Load Animations</li>
			<li>Use .csv To Generate Questions for Quiz Portion</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="pink">Incomplete Demonstration</h3>

		<p>Due to a complete PC wipe, I don't have the complete project. I only have this demonstration of the incomplete project provided by a teammate.</p>
