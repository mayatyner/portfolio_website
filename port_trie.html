            A word trie program created as an introduction to testing and refactoring in C++. <strong>
                Since this project was completed
                as a part of a class, I cannot post the code publicly.

        <h3 class="pink">Programming Experience</h3>

        <p>
            The class, called Software Practices II or CS3505, was centered on programming in C++ and in teams/pairs. This was my third assignment in C++ and it was centered
            around refactoring and creating tests in C++. My experience with pointers was rough at this point, but was improved upon in later assignments with C++.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pink">Development</h3>

        <p>
            We were provided skeleton code by our professor for this assignment. We received the names of the methods with some comments to explain the purpose of each method.
            From there, it was entirely up to us to create a trie data structure for words.
        </p>

        <p>
            After creating the orignal assignment, it was up to us to partner up with a partner, compare code, and create a refactored version. My partner and I both
            had functioning code, but we did improve the readability of the code and added more comments.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pink">Final Product</h3>

        <p>
            Below are some screenshots of my assignment. Since there is no UI for he final product, one screenshot is a snippet of tests written for the assignment
            and another screenshot is my refactoring PDF.
